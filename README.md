# Discrete Math

These are some helper functions for solving problems in Discrete Math 1.


## Usage
To run the examples:

0. Create a virtualenv and activate it.
	* Usually, `virtualenv venv`, then `. bin/activate` on Linux/Mac will do it,
	`venv\scripts\activate` on Windows.
	* If `virtualenv` doesn't exist on Windows, make sure you have pip installed.

1. Install dependencies.
	* `pip install -r requirements.txt` will do it.

2. Enjoy!
	* GCF: Currently, run `python3 cli.py <a> <b>`, replacing a and b with integers,
	to get the GCF.

3. Test!
	* All tests are easily run using `python -m pytest Tests/*`.
